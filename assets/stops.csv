1,Alumni Park,Former surface parking lot converted to public park with exhibits,Institutional,Parking lot redevelopment,Waves crashing,"Did you know Alumni Park used to be a parking lot?  It may be hard to imagine today, as the park is now a spot frequented by students and locals alike to sit and eat near the lake or discover stories about University alumni.

Eventually, that idea was realized when Alumni Park was created, completing the East Campus Mall Corridor. If you would like to learn more about alumni park, I encourage you to take some time to explore the exhibits or visit their website!<br><br>|As you walk to the next tour stop, reflect on how the built environment around you has or could have changed over the years.
